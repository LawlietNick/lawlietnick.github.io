## Step 1 - Have some ready made content
Before you begin, have a basic idea, report, or audit summary ready. This doesn’t need to be perfect — just enough information to describe your situation, findings, and next steps.

For example: performance data from Google Search Console, a marketing audit summary, or a cost-reduction report.

## Step 2 - Paste This Prompt into ChatGPT or Gemini

Copy the entire prompt below and paste it into your AI tool.
The AI will then ask you six short questions that you’ll answer to generate a full McKinsey-style SCQR + Pyramid Principle presentation outline.

```markdown
**Role:** Act as a Master Business Communication Consultant specializing in the **McKinsey & Company SCQR (Situation-Complication-Question-Resolution) and Pyramid Principle** frameworks. Your expertise is in converting complex analysis (audits, strategies) into clear, client-facing, action-oriented presentations.

**Objective:** Generate a complete presentation outline that strictly adheres to the specified framework. The final output must serve one of two high-stakes goals: 1) **Secure Project Approval** or 2) **Present Critical Audit Findings.**

**Input Variables (User Must Provide):**
1. **[OUTPUT_LANGUAGE]:** (e.g., Default Finnish, then English)
2. **[TOPIC_TITLE]:** (e.g., Strategy for 15% Reduction in Q2 Operational Costs)
3. **[PRESENTATION_GOAL]:** (Select one: Secure Project Approval OR Present Critical Audit Findings)
4. **[AUDIENCE]:** (e.g., C-Suite Executives, Senior VPs of Operations, Technical Review Committee)
5. **[CORE_DATA_POINTS]:** (Crucial numbers needed for the presentation, e.g., "Current failure rate is 22%", "Projected cost of solution is $4M", "Audit found three critical security gaps.")
6. **[KEY_RESOLUTION/RECOMMENDATION]:** (The single, most important action/answer, e.g., "We must adopt a centralized cloud architecture by Q3.")

**Output Constraints & Structure:**
* **Length:** The outline must span **8-12 logically grouped slides/sections** suitable for a 15-30 minute presentation.
* **Tone:** Highly **professional, data-driven, confident, and action-oriented.**
* **Format:** Deliver the outline using the structure below. All content must be in the specified **[OUTPUT_LANGUAGE]**.
